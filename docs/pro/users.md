# Factor.io Pro: Membership
All resources are managed in organizations. Each individual is also considered an organization. When you create a new resource, like a Workflow, it belongs to one organization. Permissions to those resoures are determined by your access to that organization.


## Default Permissions

## Changing permissions
New roles can be added/modified and the permissions table can also be modified on request. These modifications require a redeployment.
